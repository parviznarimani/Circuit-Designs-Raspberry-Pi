# About Expansions Board
Raspberry Pi is a beautiful minicomputer available widely in the market. It supports many features like most microcontrollers, besides its massive processing that could perform big computational tasks like image processing and machine learning. 
It also includes several hardware connections for expanding its functionality, but in the field of GPIOs, it's limited to only around 28 pins. Most of these pins can act as other functions. 
In this novel and beautiful design, we can quickly expand digital IOs up to 16 more, that help creator works beyond limits.
