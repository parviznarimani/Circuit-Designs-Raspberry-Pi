# Circuit-Designs-Raspberry-Pi
This repository contains all circuit board designs by Altium Designer that related to Raspberry Pi, specially includes RPi HATs and external sensors.

# Expansions IOs Series 
Raspberry Pi is a beautiful minicomputer available widely in the market. It supports many features like most microcontrollers, besides its massive processing that could perform big computational tasks like image processing and machine learning. 
It also includes several hardware connections for expanding its functionality, but in the field of GPIOs, it's limited to only around 28 pins. Most of these pins can act as other functions. 
In this novel and beautiful design, we can quickly expand digital IOs up to 16 more, that help creator works beyond limits.  

# Climate Analyzer
A climate analyzer is a platform for gathering a wide range of climate and weather live data. Climate and weather information integrate because the two systems are connected: climate is average weather.
A RaspberryÂ® Pi mini-computer is an embedded system and provides a vast amount of real-time processing for any kind of data. 
At this project, a fascinating Hat provided climate data from the real world like ambient temperature, relative humidity, pressure, and UV index. So by analyzing this data, we can have sufficient information from the surrounding.
All the designing data are available in this repository. 
Just download, and make it!!!! And enjoy :)
